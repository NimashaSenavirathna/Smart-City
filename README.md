# Urban-Governance-with-Smart-City-Solutions



🚀 **Transforming Urban Governance with Smart City Solutions!** 🏙️

Excited to share my latest project with the **Municipal Council of Panadura**, where we are working on building a **Smart City Infrastructure Management System**. This initiative aims to enhance city services and optimize urban governance for a better, more connected community.

Key features of the system include:
- 🏛️ **Employee Management** – Streamlining tasks and boosting productivity.
- 🌐 **Street Management** – Ensuring well-maintained public spaces.
- 📜 **Permit & License Management** – Simplified processes for citizens and businesses.
- ♻️ **Waste Management** – Enhancing sustainability and cleanliness.
- 🎉 **Event & Public Space Management** – Better planning and execution of public events.
- 🏥 **Healthcare & Asset Management** – Ensuring resources are effectively allocated.
- 💰 **Sales & Finance Management** – Transparent financial operations for improved efficiency.

This platform empowers three key actors:
- **Managers** – Overseeing and controlling key urban functions.
- **Employees** – Providing feedback and managing their day-to-day responsibilities.
- **Citizens** – Actively engaging with city services and providing feedback.

🌍 We're shaping the future of Panadura by embracing smart technologies to build a more sustainable and efficient city.
